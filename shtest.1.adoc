shtest - run command line tests

Synopsis
--------

shtest [-qrbefCdxh] [-s EXPR] [-E ENV] [-i INDENT] TEST+

Description
-----------

shtest is testing script which executes commands from test file and compares
with model output.

Best use cases:

- testing of command's multiple arguments under different shells
- deployment checks on new platform (to ensure oll runs korrect)

Characteristic details:

- each command is run under fresh spawned shell with predefined environment
- stdout and stderr are combined
- can be embedded in other documentation with flexible prefix
- run log with error output is stored in <test_file_name>.err

Embedding in other formats is done changing "indent" by defining it at runtime
with "-i" (indent is called "indent" to distinguish with test prefix).

Usage
-----

You just write prefixed lines, like:

    $ uname -a
    $ date

then run "shtest -r FILE.t" to refill tests and then "shtest FILE.t" .

Options
-------

-s EXPR     :: shell expression which will get test command piped to
               e.g. 'zsh -c "emulate sh;sh"' or 'bash --posix'; default is
               "/bin/sh"
-q          :: quite test; exit code set to number of failed tests
               default is verbose output
-r          :: refill all tests output (like cram -iy)
-c          :: clear all model output from test (higher priority than -r)
-i INDENT   :: indent (default is "    ")
-b          :: fail test on unhandled error code
-e          :: keep default environment (don't inherit LC_ALL and PATH from
               shell)
-E ENV      :: set custom environment prefix for each call
-f          :: force tests ignoring faults
-C          :: do not colorize diff
-d          :: discard commands stderr
-x          :: show which commands are executed
-h          :: this help

Environment
-----------

LC_ALL  :: default is C
PATH    :: by default PATH isn't passed

Without -e option environment string is concatenated with -E argument value.

Format
------

Any line not starting with indent is ignored. Any indented line without context
is ignored.

Special meaning indented lines are:

<indent> % CMD  :: auxiliary command to execute (output/exit code isn't
                   checked), no multiline commands
<indent> $ CMD  :: command to execute
<indent> > CMD  :: continuation of command
<indent> ? NUM  :: expected exit code NUM
<indent> STR    :: model output - compared until not-output line encountered or
                   EOF

Exit status
-----------

0   :: normal exit
>0  :: number of tests passed before fail
80  :: normal interrupt from test (brick with 0 exit code)
81  :: unhandled exit code from test
82  :: shtest error (mkdir faults and so on)
83  :: abnormal interrupt from test (brick with 83 exit code)

Files
-----

test_file.t     :: test file
test_file.err   :: execution log with error diffs

Bugs
----

If you get "not found" error check shebang correctness with:

    $ /bin/sh -c yourprog
